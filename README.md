# mycrud

## What do I learn?
I learnt to create a backend with node js and mongo as db

It's my first crud that I made with this techs:

- Nodejs
- HandleBars
- Mongodb

I stop the development here, because I would try to make better this crud in other repository, with other kind of techs.

You can initialize the crud, just follow this steps:

- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/smenaquispe/mycrud.git` or `git clone git@github.com:smenaquispe/mycrud.git`
- Go to the directory `/mycrud` and install dependecies with `npm install`
- In the directory create `.env` file to set enviroment vars, on that file, write something same that: [.env example](https://github.com/smenaquispe/mycrud/blob/main/.env-example)
- Finally launch the website with `npm run start`

You can see a referential image of mycrud, sorry for the styles, I will do better in the next version
